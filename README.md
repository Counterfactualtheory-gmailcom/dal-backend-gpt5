# DAL Backend GPT-5 & pgvector Testing

This repository is **not production**.  
It exists for:
- Testing GPT-5 model integrations.
- Experimenting with pgvector and ranking improvements.
- Trying out other backend features without risking production stability.

The production code lives in the separate **`dal-backend`** repo.
